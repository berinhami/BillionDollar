This is the BE-low final ideas, any idea that we have confirmed with the team will be listed here.

1. A breathalyzer that has bluetooth functionality, it will connect to your phone and when using the
breathalyzer it will display the alchol content on the BE-low app.

2. When first opening the BE-low app it will show if your device is connected or not, once it is
connected it will wait for user to blow, once the user blows it will display the reading on users
phone and if over the alchol limit it will ask if user wants to call an uber, they will be able to 
turn this function on and off in the app settings.

3. If the user selects that they want the app to call an uber then it will open the uber app idealy
with their location and ride already selected.
