In early renditions of the breathalyzer we can rely on 3d printing for our prototypes, but later on we will want to speed up production and spend less money on materials,
this is where injection molding comes in, machines can cost around 1-2k dollars for manual machines, so we will need funding for this to happen, but it is later down the
line and we will have to look in to it further then, but doing this will reduce time of creating product signifigantly, and this may be something we could have a manufacture
make.
