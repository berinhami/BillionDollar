Have a rewards section, so every time they use our app it will give them points 
that they can buy gift cards with.

Have ads that show at the bottom of the app to get us money to put into those
rewards. (we may make more money then spent on rewards)

While calling an uber it will play a little gif or maybe a short ad to get extra
revenue.

When above the drinking limit, if the user decided before hand a block list, it
will forbid them from messaging the users on the block list.

Partner with bars so when people have our device they can get a discount on alchol,
we could pay those bars with money we have made from ads or possibly government.

Partner with Insurance compaines so when users use our device they will get a
discount on their insurance this could be for health and car insurance.
