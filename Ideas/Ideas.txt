This is the BE-low Ideas Text File, any ideas that we have we can input here.

Have a rewards section, so every time they use our app it will give them points 
that they can buy gift cards with.

Have ads that show at the bottom of the app to get us money to put into those
rewards. (we may make more money then spent on rewards)

While calling an uber it will play a little gif or maybe a short ad to get extra
revenue.

When above the drinking limit, if the user decided before hand a block list, it
will forbid them from messaging the users on the block list.

Partner with bars so when people have our device they can get a discount on alchol,
we could pay those bars with money we have made from ads or possibly government.

Partner with Insurance compaines so when users use our device they will get a
discount on their insurance this could be for health and car insurance.

I think we should try to have 5 features that we showcase on advertising, those being:
1. Call an uber right to you with just 3 steps, turn on breathalyzer, open app, blow into it.
2. Prohibit yourself from texting certain people when you are drunk with our blocked contacts list.
3. Earn rewards by blowing in it one time a day, make 10 cents per blow that you can use in our store.
4. Access the Breathalyzer results straight from your phone, making our breathalyzers smaller and easier to use then competitors.
5. The price of the breathalyzer will be signifigantly lower than competitors. It will cost around 12$ to make and we will charge 
around 20-30$ in final product. making 8-18$ profit each unit. (we will be making some money off ad revenue and partnerships aswell)
